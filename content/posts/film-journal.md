This is an amazing movie. Several things stood out to me.

The majority of the film involved 3 women. This was a story told by women about other women and that was a refreshing and interesting change. I felt like I was allowed to see a world that I am not a part of.

Music was used twice and both times it was powerful and awesome. Also, it wasn't background music. It was music happening in the world of the film. During the feast held around the campfire this unnerving noise started building and building and I first I didn't know what it was. It became obvious it was a chorus of voices and they launched into an eerie and beautiful song. I lied, they used music 3 times. Marianne played a piece of music on the Harpsichord for Heloise after Heloise asked her to describe what an orchestra was like. The final scene of the movie was Marianne looking across the theater at Heloise, herself unnoticed, as the orchestral piece _The Four Seasons_ played as it zoomed in on Heloise's face. She went through grief, joy, and haunting sadness as you saw her face in profile as the sound of the music pours over you.

The last thing I noticed was how every single scene was designed and composed as if it were a painting. The Youtube channel _Every Frame a Painting_ comes to mind. It helped that the scenery, set design, and costumes were all gorgeous.

So to recap, I noticed an absence of male perspective, a sparse but powerful use of music, and how each scene was composed as if it were a painting.

I also enjoyed the long shots, minimalist but beautifully written dialogue, and powerful symbolism. It was an exquisite tragedy, but I'm not sure it should be labeled as a tragedy.
