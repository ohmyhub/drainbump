## 2021-09-06, Monday {#2021-09-06-monday}


#### 23rd of Eleasis continued {#23rd-of-eleasis-continued}

<!--list-separator-->

-  The party has a moment to consider if they want to press on to Tumen Ord or go back to Ice End

<!--list-separator-->

-  Yellow Arrow is another warlord

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  She leads a nomadic group that has not sworn fealty to Firefist

<!--list-separator-->

-  Firefist would respect someone who could defeat him in combat

<!--list-separator-->

-  We communicate to Okin and Chimbai that we are not people to be trifled and tell him to communicate that to his leader

<!--list-separator-->

-  We let them leave, and give them some food for their journey home

<!--list-separator-->

-  Okin thanks us and tells us where their former camp was

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  He told us they had buried some loot there, and we were welcome to it

<!--list-separator-->

-  Maslin is probably going to accept the title and land that Lady Cliffsend offered her

<!--list-separator-->

-  The party travels for 4 days

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  It goes relatively smoothly


#### 1st of Eleint {#1st-of-eleint}

<!--list-separator-->

-  The days are long and hot

<!--list-separator-->

-  We near the area that Okin described to us

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  A camp set within a cave

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  To reach it we must ascend some switchbacks with stairs carved into the cliffs

<!--list-separator-->

-  Derwood notices some tracks along the path

<!--list-separator-->

-  Kristif is able to tell there was a party of about a dozen that passed through here

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  It's a mix of goblin and orc sized foot prints

<!--list-separator-->

-  They spot another set of prints that are much larger and have a longer stride

<!--list-separator-->

-  Derwood casts Pass Without Trace on the party

<!--list-separator-->

-  We make good time and track the footprints while staying stealthy thanks to Derwood

<!--list-separator-->

-  There are two orcs and two goblins

<!--list-separator-->

-  Tool tries to become friends with them but they rebuff him and tell him to get lost

<!--list-separator-->

-  The party is curious about what they're up to

<!--list-separator-->

-  Maslin, Kristif, and Tool are going to hang back and be a distraction

<!--list-separator-->

-  Marlowe and Derwood are going to be stealthy and sneak past the orcs

<!--list-separator-->

-  There are a bunch of orcs, goblins, wolves, a hill giant, and a small copper dragon

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Copper dragons are generally tricksters and covetous

<!--list-separator-->

-  Tool, Kristif, and Maslin are confronted by the orcs Tool spoke with earlier

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  They don't want to kill us but they work for the dragon and they will try if we don't leave

<!--list-separator-->

-  Kristif sends a message to Marlowe to let her know we're packing up

<!--list-separator-->

-  The party decides this isn't a fight worth having

<!--list-separator-->

-  Before they come back Marlowe and Derwood check out the cave real quick

<!--list-separator-->

-  After the party regroups and after much deliberation we determine that we can't allow this dragon and it's army to roam across the continent unimpeded

<!--list-separator-->

-  They warned us that they would attack if they saw us again, so we try to surprise them

<!--list-separator-->

-  Derwood was spotted by some goblin archers

<!--list-separator-->

-  It's combat encounter time!     :combat:

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Marlowe blasts some goblin archers with eldritch magic

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  An orc fumbles with a horn

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Derwood is pierced by arrows

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  They were poisoned!

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Derwood fires arrows from his longbow at the orc with the horn

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Tool hurls himself at the cliff and manages to reach the top

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  He roars a challenge to the orcs and goblins

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Maslin unleashes an explosion on the side of the cliff

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  The goblins are caught in the explosion

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  One dies immediately and the other splats at the bottom of the cliff

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  After hearing the explosion the orcs and goblins higher up the hill charge down to us

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  One orc tries to stab me with a spear but fails miserably

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  The hill giant hurls a boulder at Tool

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  It was an impressive throw but it sails way past all of us

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Maslin attacks with deadly magic

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Kristif blasts an orc with sacred flame

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Marlowe hexes and blasts that same orc and he tumbles at Tool's feet

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  The wolves move in to attack

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  One gets close enough to Tool to get a smack

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Goblins shoot at Tool but he's a slippery one today

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  The goblins attempt to hide after firing at Tool

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Derwood puts one of the wolves down with a volley of arrows

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  The other one soon follows

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Tool has no one around him now so he rushes forward and kills the first orc he comes to

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Maslin summons their spiritual weapon and attacks one of the goblins

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  They slay the goblin

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  The hill giant misses tool with another boulder

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Kristif dashes further up the hill

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Marlowe advances

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  The goblins are unable to hit Tool with their arrows

        <!--list-separator-->

        -  They begin to flee back towards the caverns

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Tool steams ahead likely a locomotive and takes out two of the fleeing goblins

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Maslin sends their spiritual sword at the remaining goblin

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Then Maslin commands the hill giant to stand there and do nothing

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Kristif summons lightening and channels their divinity and blasts the hill giant with 30 damage

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Marlowe blasts the giant with eldritch magic but it is somehow still standing

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  Derwood takes careful aim and pierces the giant with arrows

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  With tears streaming down his face bashes in the head of the hill giant

<!--list-separator-->

-  The party enters the cave that Marlowe and Derwood had scouted before

<!--list-separator-->

-  Where is the dragon?

<!--list-separator-->

-  Derwood is going to turn into a crab so we can throw him up a cliff wall

<!--list-separator-->

-  Before he was able to change arrows flew out of the darkness

<!--list-separator-->

-  It's cave attack time!     :combat:

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  The arrows had come from a small craggy opening high on the cave wall

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  It appeared to be a small tunnel

    <!--list-separator-->

    -  We soon found ourselves engaged with orcs, goblins, and wolves
