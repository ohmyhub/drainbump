# 23rd of Eleasis continued {#23rd-of-eleasis-continued}

*  The party has a moment to consider if they want to press on to Tumen Ord or go back to Ice End
*  Yellow Arrow is another warlord
    *  She leads a nomadic group that has not sworn fealty to Firefist
*  Firefist would respect someone who could defeat him in combat
*  We communicate to Okin and Chimbai that we are not people to be trifled and tell him to communicate that to his leader
*  We let them leave, and give them some food for their journey home
*  Okin thanks us and tells us where their former camp was
    *  He told us they had buried some loot there, and we were welcome to it
*  **Maslin** is probably going to accept the title and land that Lady Cliffsend offered her
*  The party travels for 4 days
    *  It goes relatively smoothly


# 1st of Eleint {#1st-of-eleint}

*  The days are long and hot
*  We near the area that Okin described to us
    *  A camp set within a cave
    *  To reach it we must ascend some switchbacks with stairs carved into the cliffs
*  **Derwood** notices some tracks along the path
*  **Kristif** is able to tell there was a party of about a dozen that passed through here
    *  It's a mix of goblin and orc sized foot prints
*  They spot another set of prints that are much larger and have a longer stride
*  **Derwood** casts Pass Without Trace on the party
*  We make good time and track the footprints while staying stealthy thanks to **Derwood**
*  There are two orcs and two goblins
*  **Tool** tries to become friends with them but they rebuff him and tell him to get lost
*  The party is curious about what they're up to
*  **Maslin**, **Kristif**, and **Tool** are going to hang back and be a distraction
*  **Marlowe** and **Derwood** are going to be stealthy and sneak past the orcs
*  There are a bunch of orcs, goblins, wolves, a hill giant, and a small copper dragon
    *  Copper dragons are generally tricksters and covetous
*  **Tool**, **Kristif**, and **Maslin** are confronted by the orcs **Tool** spoke with earlier
    *  They don't want to kill us but they work for the dragon and they will try if we don't leave
*  **Kristif** sends a message to **Marlowe** to let her know we're packing up
*  The party decides this isn't a fight worth having
*  Before they come back **Marlowe** and **Derwood** check out the cave real quick
*  After the party regroups and after much deliberation we determine that we can't allow this dragon and it's army to roam across the continent unimpeded
*  They warned us that they would attack if they saw us again, so we try to surprise them
*  **Derwood** was spotted by some goblin archers
*  It's combat encounter time!
    *  **Marlowe** blasts some goblin archers with eldritch magic
    *  An orc fumbles with a horn
    *  **Derwood** is pierced by arrows
        *  They were poisoned!
    *  **Derwood** fires arrows from his longbow at the orc with the horn
    *  **Tool** hurls himself at the cliff and manages to reach the top
        *  He roars a challenge to the orcs and goblins
    *  **Maslin** unleashes an explosion on the side of the cliff
        *  The goblins are caught in the explosion
        *  One dies immediately and the other splats at the bottom of the cliff
    *  After hearing the explosion the orcs and goblins higher up the hill charge down to us
    *  One orc tries to stab me with a spear but fails miserably
    *  The hill giant hurls a boulder at **Tool**
        *  It was an impressive throw but it sails way past all of us
    *  **Maslin** attacks with deadly magic
    *  **Kristif** blasts an orc with sacred flame
    *  **Marlowe** hexes and blasts that same orc and he tumbles at **Tool**'s feet
    *  The wolves move in to attack
    *  One gets close enough to **Tool** to get a smack
    *  Goblins shoot at **Tool** but he's a slippery one today
    *  The goblins attempt to hide after firing at **Tool**
    *  **Derwood** puts one of the wolves down with a volley of arrows
        *  The other one soon follows
    *  **Tool** has no one around him now so he rushes forward and kills the first orc he comes to
    *  **Maslin** summons their spiritual weapon and attacks one of the goblins
        *  They slay the goblin
    *  The hill giant misses tool with another boulder
    *  **Kristif** dashes further up the hill
    *  **Marlowe** advances
    *  The goblins are unable to hit **Tool** with their arrows
        *  They begin to flee back towards the caverns
    *  **Tool** steams ahead likely a locomotive and takes out two of the fleeing goblins
    *  **Maslin** sends their spiritual sword at the remaining goblin
    *  Then **Maslin** commands the hill giant to stand there and do nothing
    *  **Kristif** summons lightening and channels their divinity and blasts the hill giant with 30 damage
    *  **Marlowe** blasts the giant with eldritch magic but it is somehow still standing
    *  **Derwood** takes careful aim and pierces the giant with arrows
    *  With tears streaming down his face bashes in the head of the hill giant
*  The party enters the cave that **Marlowe** and **Derwood** had scouted before
*  Where is the dragon?
*  **Derwood** is going to turn into a crab so we can throw him up a cliff wall
*  Before he was able to change arrows flew out of the darkness
*  It's cave attack time!
    *  The arrows had come from a small craggy opening high on the cave wall
    *  It appeared to be a small tunnel
    *  We soon found ourselves engaged with orcs, goblins, and wolves
